# Assignment 1: Protests

During the past few years in the United States, there has been a surge of protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, women's rights, trans rights, immigration reform, gun control, the environment, and many other social and political issues.

In this assignment, you will work with data from [CountLove](https://countlove.org/), a group that collects data about protests from across the United States, including information about the purpose of the protests, the location of the protests, as well as how many people attended the protests. This data has often been [cited by the *New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/us/black-lives-matter-protest.html), among other major outlets.

Through this assignment, you will be able to answer questions including:
- What were the most attended and least attended protests in the US in the last 5 years?
- How many protests occurred in Washington state?
- How did the number of protests in 2019 compare to 2020, and why?
- Why are people protesting in the US? What are the biggest motivators?


This assignment is divided into 2 parts. You will complete your coding work in the `analysis.R` file, and you will write short answer responses related to critical analysis and reflection of the data in this `README.md` file. Before getting started on your coding work, you should complete the section **"Critical Analysis & Reflection: Before You Code"** below.

When you are finished with the assignment, be sure to push all changes to your GitHub repository and then submit the link on Canvas.

## Before You Code: Critical Analysis & Reflection

Before diving into this (or any) dataset, it's important to know where the data came from, and it's important to have or to seek out _domain familiarity_ — in other words, knowledge about the subject/topic of the dataset. (We don't want to be "strangers in the dataset," as Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein describe it.)

To get more familiar, we are going to begin by doing some background reading.

- First, please read [this FAQ](https://countlove.org/faq.html) from the CountLove website and the opening of [this blog post](https://www.tommyleung.com/countLove/index.htm). Based on the information in these pieces, why did the creators start collecting the CountLove data? Please answer in 2-3 sentences (3 points)
They said that protest are a way of comunicating with elected leaders.They hope that the demonstration will help cizitzens. 

- Next, we would like you to read this [*New York Times* piece, which uses CountLove data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/13/us/george-floyd-protests-cities-photos.html) (here's a [Google Doc version for anyone who gets paywalled](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdjFsA5csYuH4plNEEk7WXT77K5h5ZuyW05CBwYdk6A/edit?usp=sharing)), and which describes the Black Lives Matter protests that occurred in the summer of 2020. Please summarize the main point or argument of this article in 2-3 sentences (3 points) The main point is that a lot of people protested. Not just in one state but in all the states there was protests. Black lives matter reached all over america.

Next, we're going to reflect about who collected this data, and what's actually inside it.

- Who collected and shared the CountLove data, and what do they do for a living? Please answer in 1-2 sentences(2 points) 

The people who collected the data are Tommy Leung and Nathan Perkins. They are engineers and scientists with a keen interest in civic responsibility and public policy

- As Klein and D'Ignazio remind us, when it comes to data, "what gets counted counts." What types of demonstrations does CountLove include in their data, and what types do they exclude? (3 points)

They count public displays of protest. They do not include awareness events, commemorative celebrations, historic reenactments, fundraising events, townhalls, or political campaign rallies.

- How and where does CountLove get their data about the protests? Please answer in 2-3 sentences (2 points)

They crawl local newspaper and television sites on a daily basis. Thats where they get most of their data from.

- How does CountLove make their estimates about the number of people who attended a protest? What potential problems might arise from this method of estimation? Please answer in 3-4 sentences (4 points)

They get their count from news articles that they link. They interpret “a dozen” as 10, “dozens” as 20, “hundreds” as 100.

## While You Code: Critical Analysis & Reflection

- Reflection 1: Why do you think the mean is higher than the median? Which metric would you use in a report about this data, and why? Please answer in 2-3 sentences (2 points) 

The mean is bigger because it includes all protests and the median is just the middle number. I would use the mean because there was multiple protests in america and the middle number would not be an accurate number for all those protests.

- Reflection 2: Before actually calculating the number of protests that occurred in 2018, 2019, 2020, record your guesses for the following questions. (1 point)

  Guess: Do you think there were more protests in 2019 than in 2018? Why or why not? Please answer in 1 or 2 sentences
  
  There was more protests in 2019 because I do not remeber any protests in 2018.

  Guess: Do you think there were more protests in 2020 than in 2019? Why or why not? Please answer in 1 or 2 sentences
  
  There was more protests in 2020 because black lives matter movement was huge it was all over the US, the movement made so many people protest all around the US.

- Reflection 3: Does the change in the number of protests from 2018 to 2019 to 2020 surprise you? Why or why not? What do you think explains the fluctuation? Please answer in 1 or 2 sentences (2 points)

It does not surprise me because the protest happened for different reasons and in 2020 there was the biggest movement I have seen.

- Reflection 4: What is the first and fourth most frequent category of protest? Do these frequencies align with your sense of the major protest movements in the U.S. in the last few years? Why or why not? (3 points)

Number one is nonviolent protests. Second is violent protests. Third is silent protests. Fourth is boycotting something. Yes because all those types of protests I have seen before and I am young.

## After You Code: Critical Analysis & Reflection

In the second chapter of *Data Feminism*, Klein and D'Ignazio describe 4 ways that data scientists can challenge power and take action:
> Taking action can itself take many forms, and in this chapter we offer four starting points:  
> (1) Collect: Compiling counterdata—in the face of missing data or institutional neglect—offers a powerful starting point as we see in the example of the DGEI, or in María Salguero’s femicide maps discussed in chapter 1.  
> (2) Analyze: Challenging power often requires demonstrating inequitable outcomes across groups, and new computational methods are being developed to audit opaque algorithms and hold institutions accountable.  
> (3) Imagine: We cannot only focus on inequitable outcomes, because then we will never get to the root cause of injustice. In order to truly dismantle power, we have to imagine our end point not as “fairness,” but as co-liberation.  
> (4) Teach: The identities of data scientists matter, so how might we engage and empower newcomers to the field in order to shift the demographics and cultivate the next generation of data feminists?  

- How does the CountLove project embody one or more of these 4 forms of challenging power? Please answer in at least 3-4 sentences (3 points)

CountLove emobodys analyze form of challenging power. The reason they emobody analyze is because they collect data from all protest about one movement. Analyze is about collecting data from across groups.

- What is the most interesting or surprising thing you learned from this analysis? Please answer in at least 2-3 sentences (2 points) 

The most interesting thing I learned from this analysis was there was so many protests that I did not know about. There was so many even before the black lives matter movement.

- What is a kind of analysis that you would like to do or that would be interesting to do with the CountLove data that you don't have the time or skills to accomplish at this moment? Please answer in at least 2-3 sentences (2 points)

I would like to find how many people attend a protest. I find the way countlove get their attedees number very interesting.
